# parseExecutionChain
Quick, dirty, brittle py code to parse (most) execution chains from files in repos like [@pr0xylife](https://twitter.com/pr0xylife)'s excellent [Qakbot](https://github.com/pr0xylife/Qakbot) and [other](https://github.com/pr0xylife?tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=&sort=) collections

Outputs execution chains in format "file extension > file extension" into a .csv file, e.g. parsedExecutionChains.csv
